  How can we know how good we’ve got it without really understanding how good we
  used to have it? JavaScript was first released with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in
  September 1995 - can an application from today exist in the browsers of
  yesterday?



  Just how different was the development experience then compared to now? Is it
  feasible to implement a modern Web application in the browser that pioneered
  client-side development? What would code from 1995 look like rewritten with
  today’s JavaScript?



  In this talk I will answer those questions by implementing TodoMVC in some
  early browsers. When we’re through, we’ll leave with an appreciation of just
  how far the Web and Web development have come in the last 20 years.
