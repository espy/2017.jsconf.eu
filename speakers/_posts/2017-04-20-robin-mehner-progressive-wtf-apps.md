description: "In mid 2016 we set out to build a progressive web app to help people in Africa fight their diabetes and live a better life. The road was bumpy and filled with bugs, misunderstandings, browser challenges, spacer-GIFs and wrong documentation, but eventually we were ready for launch! Only, our enthusiasm didn't last long as we've took a big hit from reality. In this talk I'll recap our experiences building a PWA, share our learnings, highlight some of the mistakes we made and tell you what saved us in the end."
