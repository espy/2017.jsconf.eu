GoCardless is a London-based startup that makes it simple for anyone to take Direct Debit payments.   After just 4 years we're processing over $1bn annually. Our vision is to create an international Direct Debit network to power simple payments for the Internet.

We believe in an accessible and diverse JavaScript community and try to contribute back whenever we can — both in our day to day by open sourcing our work, and by supporting the development of SystemJS.

We are proud to be affiliated with the community effort of JSConf. Making technology more human is close to our hearts ♥
