We make [Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), [Push](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) and [Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/). With these products, a diverse community of artists creates amazing things. We are based in Berlin and our company is run by its founders. Many of us are musicians, producers and DJs.

To us, sponsoring JSConf is a great way to give back to the vibrant Berlin tech community and support open web technologies. We’ve only started to scratch the surface of what’s possible with the Web, and we can’t wait to see what people build with exciting new technologies like Web Audio and Web MIDI.
