At home24, we’re revolutionising how people buy furniture. As Europe’s most popular home and living shopping platform, we’re leading the change in how the world buys furniture, driving it online and out of crowded stores. Our focus is two-fold; providing a broad and relevant assortment of home & living products, and a wonderful shopping experience to our customers. And we want to be the best at it. 

Our 100+ dedicated tech department are one of the keys to making that happen. Organised into tribes, squads and guilds, we are constantly improving and updating our technology, and seeking out the smartest solutions to keep home24 at the forefront of the home and living market. We work with Golang, Java, Scala, Swift, Reactjs, Node.js, Spark and AWS Lambda to name but a few.

We’re a small enough team to know each other well, and large enough to really make an impact. We trust our teams to do the best job possible - we provide the tools and structure for you to make your mark. How significant that is, is up to you.
